# OpenWebsitesInterest
Use this command to open websites of your choice (in Goal first column) :
'''bash
python3 open_website.py -p /home/jacky/projects/OpenWebsitesInterest/ -f list_websites.txt -c fun
'''
Here I want to open websites included in my file. I can only open those whose name in the first column matches.
